Sorttest is a program which reads numbers from the command line,
outputs them, sorts them in descending order, and outputs the sorted list.

Sorttest2 is a program which generates random numbers based on number entered in the command line.
Additionally, it outputs them, sorts them in descending order, and outputs the sorted list.
This program can use array indexing or pointers for sorting. Pointer operation based sorting is
faster due to less mathematical operations required for accessing array elements. 


HOW TO RUN:

1. In your terminal, run the make command. 
This will output to executable files called Sorttest and Sorttest2. 

2. ./Sorttest some_number another_number ... or ./sorttest2 some_number another_number

For sort test you must pass in as many elements as you'd like in the command line. It will print and
sort elements passed in the command line and specify how much time is required. 


For sort test 2 you must pass in a number in the command line specifying
how the number of randomly generated values you would like. It will print and
sort elements passed in the command line and specify how much time is required.
The second command line argument will determine if you use array indexing or 
pointer operations for your sorting. 

1: denotes use default sort_descending, whereas 0 will use pointer sorting.
